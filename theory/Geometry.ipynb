    "# Geometric Interpretation of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents a geometric interpretation of linear regression, showing that the optimal prediction vector is obtained by projecting the target vector $y$ onto the column space of the design matrix $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Column Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The column space of $X$, denoted as $\\text{Col}(X)$, is the subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^m$ spanned by the columns of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any parameter vector $\\theta$, the predicted response\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = X\\theta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "lies in the column space of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed target vector $y$ does not lie in $\\text{Col}(X)$. Linear regression seeks $\\hat{y} \\in \\text{Col}(X)$ closest to $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\text{proj}_{\\text{Col}(X)}(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orthogonality\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual $r = y - \\hat{y}$ is orthogonal to $\\text{Col}(X)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X^\\top r = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normal Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "From $X^\\top (y - X\\theta) = 0$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X^\\top X\\theta = X^\\top y$$"
