    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"This section presents a geometric interpretation of linear regression, showing that the optimal prediction vector is obtained by projecting the target vector $y$ onto the column space of the design matrix $X$. This viewpoint explains the normal equation as a consequence of orthogonality between the residual vector and the feature space.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Column Space of the Design Matrix\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"The column space of the design matrix $X$, denoted as $\\\\text{Col}(X)$, is the subspace of $\\\\mathbb{R}^m$ spanned by the columns of $X$. Any vector in $\\\\text{Col}(X)$ can be written as a linear combination of the columns of $X$.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"$$\\\\hat{y} = X\\\\theta$$\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"lies in the column space of $X$. Therefore, linear regression restricts predictions to vectors that belong to $\\\\text{Col}(X)$.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"## Projection of the Target Vector\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"In general, the observed target vector $y$ does not lie in the column space of $X$. Linear regression therefore seeks a vector $\\\\hat{y} \\\\in \\\\text{Col}(X)$ that is closest to $y$ in the Euclidean sense.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"This closest vector is obtained by orthogonally projecting $y$ onto the column space of $X$. The resulting vector $\\\\hat{y} = X\\\\theta$ represents the best linear approximation to $y$ within $\\\\text{Col}(X)$.\\n\",\n",

    "    \"$$r = y - \\\\hat{y} = y - X\\\\theta.$$\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"A fundamental property of orthogonal projection is that the residual vector is orthogonal to the subspace onto which the projection is made. Therefore, the residual $r$ is orthogonal to the column space of $X$:\\n\",\n",
